Welcome to buffer overflow lab! (Lab 1)

# Overview

There are three directories here, each with important bits of code.

## targets/

This contains the source and Makefile for all of the targets. Make
sure to build everything in here (`make`). You should _not_ modify the
targets in any way, as it will likely cause your exploit to only work
on the modified version.

## exploits/

This contains skeleton code for all exploits and a Makefile. Build with
`make`.

## printf-exercises/

These are small exploitation/exploration toys for learning about
printf exploitation. Optional, but highly recommended before working
on the printf exploit!


## buffer-exercises/

These are several small set-the-admin-flag exercises. 1 and 2 are
solvable and good warmups. X is different, and only for fun.
